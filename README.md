Data from TMDB Website
The movie data used for this project is sourced from The Movie Database (TMDb). TMDb provides a vast collection of movie information, including movie titles, genres, and posters, which serve as valuable data to build the recommender system.

The recommender system uses cosine similarity to calculate the similarity scores between movies. By analyzing the feature vectors of different movies, the system determines their degree of similarity. Based on these similarity scores, the model then suggests the top 5 movies that are most closely related to the user's selected movie.

The application's user interface is built using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly platform for users to interact with the Movie Recommender System effortlessly. finally deployed with Heroku.

With this system, movie enthusiasts can find movies that align with their preferences and explore similar films that they might not have encountered otherwise.
